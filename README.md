Intelligent spacecrafts learn to fly and land on landing pad.

My name is Preston Stecklein,
I am seeking Software Engineering internships for the summer of 2021.

While working my current internship this summer and fall, I have been working hard on side projects as well.

This project involves machine learning, using Neural Networks and genetic algorithms.

This project uses the HTML canvas element, so for the best experience, if on mobile, use landscape mode, otherwise, larger devices are okay

The program involves a population of spacecrafts, and they must learn to fly and land on the landing pad.

In order for a successful landing, the crafts must have a low speed while approaching the pad, else there will result a "crash landing". The current requirements for a safe landing are values of lower than 1.5 for both X and Y speed. These values are relatively high, but they make for a better demo, as the spacecrafts will take less generations to land successfully, consistently. If you want to change the values, "0.5" will provide a better challenge for the AI, and it will take more generations to achieve success for a majority of the population.

Overall, I hope you enjoy the project, I worked hard and learned a lot from this.
